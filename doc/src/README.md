# Introduction

**Emulot** is a tool suite including a command line interface as well for managing emulator instances and configurations, specifically 
focused on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org). The idea is to be able to easy store,
share, and run instances without needing to remember all the details. The
configurations are currently accepted as TOML represenations of the QEMU command
line options.
